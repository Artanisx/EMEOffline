## Goal of the game
This main goal of the game is to mine asteroids, refine them into minerals, sell them for credits and use said credits to buy upgrade for your ship. The game closely resembles EVE Online (a very *very* small fraction of its features), in 2D. You control the ship pointing and clicking or through the use of the overview window, to move, warp, dock and mine.
The final goal is to obtain the coveted Mining Laser V and the very spacious Cargo Hold Extender V. After then, well... sky's the limit!

# Power Ups
You can buy 4 levels of Mining Lasers and 5 levels of Cargo Hold Extenders.

## Controls
The game is mainly controlled with the mouse. You can select objects in the Overview, click buttons to take actions (such as "MOVE", "WARP", "DOCK" and "MINE") that are dependant on the selected object and it's distance.

A far away object will let you warp to it, whereas a more close one can be reached with a move action or can be mined (if it's an asteroid) or docked (if it's a station).

**Mouse: Left Click** Use the left button of your mouse on an empty spot in space to move your ship there. The ship will increase its speed to the maximum and then automatically slow down once you reach it.

**ESC** to quit the game, skip the tutorial or undock (if in Station).
